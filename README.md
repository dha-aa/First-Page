This is my first HTML page project. It is a simple **About Page** built using only HTML. No CSS or JavaScript is included.

Open a terminal and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dha-aa/First-Page.git

#### Option 1: Open Directly in Browser
Simply double-click `index.html`, and it will open in your default web browser.

#### Option 2: Run with Python HTTP Server
To serve the HTML file on a local server, use **Python**:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```
Now, open your browser and go to:
