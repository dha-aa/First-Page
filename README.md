# First Page

This is my first HTML page project. It is a simple **About Page** built using only HTML. No CSS or JavaScript is included.

## How to Run

### Option 1: Open in Browser Directly
1. Double-click the `index.html` file, and it will open in your web browser.

### Option 2: Run with Python HTTP Server
If you want to run a local server using Python:

#### For Python 3:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

#### For Python 2:
```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

Then, open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:8000
```

## Folder Structure
```bash
First-Page/
â”‚-- index.html
â”‚-- README.md
```

## Future Improvements
- Add styling with CSS
- Make it responsive
- Include JavaScript for interactivity
